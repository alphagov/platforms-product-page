# GOV.UK Platforms product page
GOV.UK Platforms product page describes some of the platforms that Government Digital Service offers and can be accessed on [platforms.service.gov.uk](https://platforms.service.gov.uk/). There is no software required to be installed to get the local version working, such as npm or docker.

##Development
This was based on the [product-page-example](https://github.com/alphagov/product-page-example) and uses the [GOV.UK Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend). There is a sign up form which links to a Mailchimp account.
